# Hear Ye, Hear Ye!

Make your voices heard, and your vote actually matter!
See if your representatives are voting
with you or against you in the app "Hear Ye"

### Overview

This app shows users how their fellow citizens
(anonymously) are voting compared to their
representative. A lot of the times, it's
the opposite of the constituents'.

For example, in Michigan, located in the 
middle of the Great Lakes which [contains 21% of the world's
surface fresh water by volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes),
many Republican-dominated districts are environmentalists
unlike the rest of the party, yet their representatives
vote for the construction of an oil pipeline
literally in the freshwater lake.

Eyy Michigan pride!

### Inspiration

Most Congressmen only vote with their parties
so that they can have enough funding and a salary
for another election. Gone are the days of
bipartisanship to the point that Congressmen on both
sides of the aisle don't talk to each other without
being called "traitors" instead of "pals." Today,
there's an absolute need for just a _TINY_
bit of bipartisanship that has been forgotten
since the '90s; you'll see retired Congressmen
wish for bipartisanship to **return** without
actually committing to it themselves.

So let's make them commit to it with our votes.

### How to Run

This app is still in development.

#### Hack away

We use React Native to build this because Andrew
wanted to learn it and didn't have the resources
to keep this developing.

If you use nvm, run `nvm use`. Then:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run android` or `npm run ios`
3. To use the hot-reload, just head 
   back to the simulator. Make sure Metro is running.

I'm going to be happy if Congressmen start
saying "haha sucka. I ain't gettin' rolled today."
Ahh wishful thinking... Can you imagine like a
leader of a party standing right behind you saying
"you ain voting for the other side right? Hope not..."
with like a grim face and deadly stare... No devil horns;
just blankly staring into the universe. The lack of attention
from the eye to yours and more from the eye to the ballot box
is worse if you think about it.
